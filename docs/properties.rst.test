Properties
==========

**doublex** supports stub and spy properties in a pretty easy way in relation to other
frameworks like python-mock.

That requires two constraints:

* It does not support "free" doubles. ie: you must give a collaborator in the constructor.
* collaborator must be a new-style class. See the next example.


Stubbing properties
-------------------

.. testcode:: stub-property
.. sourcecode:: python

   from doublex import Spy, assert_that, is_

   with Spy(Collaborator) as spy:
       spy.prop = 2  # stubbing 'prop' value

   assert_that(spy.prop, is_(2))  # double property getter invoked


Spying properties
-----------------

Continuing previous example:

.. testcode:: spy-property
.. sourcecode:: python

   from doublex import Spy, assert_that, never
   from doublex import property_got, property_set

   class Collaborator(object):
       @property
       def prop(self):
           return 1

       @prop.setter
       def prop(self, value):
           pass

   spy = Spy(Collaborator)
   value = spy.prop

   assert_that(spy, property_got('prop'))  # property 'prop' was read.

   spy.prop = 4
   spy.prop = 5
   spy.prop = 5

   assert_that(spy, property_set('prop'))  # was set to any value
   assert_that(spy, property_set('prop').to(4))
   assert_that(spy, property_set('prop').to(5).times(2))
   assert_that(spy, never(property_set('prop').to(6)))


Mocking properties
------------------

Getting property:

.. testcode:: spy-property
.. sourcecode:: python

   from doublex import Mock, assert_that, verify

   with Mock(Collaborator) as mock:
       mock.prop

   mock.prop

   assert_that(mock, verify())


Setting property:

.. testcode:: spy-property
.. sourcecode:: python

   from doublex import Mock, assert_that, verify

   with Mock(Collaborator) as mock:
       mock.prop = 5

   mock.prop = 5

   assert_that(mock, verify())


Using matchers:

.. testcode:: spy-property
.. sourcecode:: python

   from hamcrest import all_of, greater_than, less_than
   from doublex import Mock, assert_that, verify

   with Mock(Collaborator) as mock:
       mock.prop = all_of(greater_than(8), less_than(12))

   mock.prop = 10

   assert_that(mock, verify())
